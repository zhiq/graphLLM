# graphLLM

Overall goal is to perform a comparative analysis of LLM output responses augmented by three different augmentors: 

- Textual information (source material)
- Graph information (structural representation of the source material) or 
- A combination of both textual and graph.

This research went through two stages. Stage one was generation, where specimens for testing were generated. Stage two was evaluation, where the specimens — LLM responses — were evaluated.

The top 3 leading frontier LLMs — Claude 3.5 Sonnet, OpenAI GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro — were used for generation and evaluation.
